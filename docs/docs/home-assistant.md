# Home Assistant integration

## Viewing the dashboard via the sidebar (Ingress)

If DynGlance opens with all the page structure and content but none of the
styling (no colors, unstyled default browser buttons/checkboxes, everything
stacked full-width) when opened from the Home Assistant sidebar - but looks
fine when opened directly in its own browser tab - this was a real bug in
versions before the fix below and has been resolved: DynGlance now reads the
`X-Ingress-Path` header Supervisor sends on every Ingress request and uses it
to prefix every generated link, script, and stylesheet URL, instead of only
supporting a fixed `server.base-url` set at config time (which can't work for
Ingress anyway, since each install's `/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/` prefix is
random and only known at runtime, not when you write `dynglance.yml`). Update
to a build that includes this fix if you still see the issue - no
config change is needed for it to take effect.

DynGlance has no Home Assistant-specific widget, but you can pull data out of
Home Assistant's REST API into the `custom-api` widget with no code changes.
Because `custom-api` fetches and renders server-side, your Home Assistant
token is never sent to the browser - anyone viewing the dashboard sees only
the rendered HTML, so this works even with DynGlance's own authentication
turned off (e.g. behind the Home Assistant add-on's Ingress, or on a kiosk
display that has no login of its own).

## 1. Create a long-lived access token in Home Assistant

In Home Assistant, go to your profile (bottom left) → **Security** →
**Long-lived access tokens** → **Create Token**. Copy it somewhere safe; you
won't be able to see it again.

**Running as the Home Assistant add-on:** paste the token into the add-on's
**Configuration** tab, under **Home Assistant long-lived token** - it's never
typed into `dynglance.yml` at all. The add-on passes it through as the
`HA_TOKEN` environment variable, so your widgets reference it the same way
either way (see step 2).

**Running standalone (Docker/binary):** pass it in as an environment
variable yourself and reference it with `${env:HA_TOKEN}` (see
[Templating / variables](configuration.md#configuring-dynglance) for the
`${env:...}`/`${secret:...}` syntax) rather than pasting it directly into
`dynglance.yml`.

Either way, treat this token like a password: anyone who has it can read
(and, depending on scope, control) your Home Assistant instance. Don't
commit it to version control.

## 2. Display a single entity's state

```yaml
- type: custom-api
  title: Living Room Temperature
  cache: 30s
  url: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/states/sensor.living_room_temperature
  headers:
    Authorization: "Bearer ${env:HA_TOKEN}"
  template: |
    <div class="size-h2">{{ .JSON.String "state" }}°{{ .JSON.String "attributes.unit_of_measurement" }}</div>
    <div class="color-highlight">{{ .JSON.String "attributes.friendly_name" }}</div>
```

Replace `homeassistant.local:8123` with your instance's address (if
DynGlance is running as the Home Assistant add-on, the Supervisor's internal
hostname works instead - see step 4).

## 3. Display several entities in one widget

Use `subrequests` to fetch multiple entities concurrently and combine them in
a single widget, instead of adding one `custom-api` widget per entity:

```yaml
- type: custom-api
  title: Home
  cache: 30s
  headers: &ha-auth
    Authorization: "Bearer ${env:HA_TOKEN}"
  url: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/states/sensor.living_room_temperature
  subrequests:
    humidity:
      url: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/states/sensor.living_room_humidity
      headers: *ha-auth
    front_door:
      url: http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/states/binary_sensor.front_door
      headers: *ha-auth
  template: |
    {{ $humidity := .Subrequest "humidity" }}
    {{ $door := .Subrequest "front_door" }}
    <div class="flex justify-between">
      <span>Temperature</span>
      <span>{{ .JSON.String "state" }}°{{ .JSON.String "attributes.unit_of_measurement" }}</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex justify-between">
      <span>Humidity</span>
      <span>{{ $humidity.JSON.String "state" }}%</span>
    </div>
    <div class="flex justify-between">
      <span>Front door</span>
      <span>{{ if eq ($door.JSON.String "state") "on" }}Open{{ else }}Closed{{ end }}</span>
    </div>
```

See [custom-api.md](custom-api.md) for the full templating reference
(loops, conditionals, formatting helpers) and the `subrequests` property
documentation in [configuration.md](configuration.md#subrequests).

## 4. Why there's no "no-token" shortcut anymore

Earlier builds of the add-on set `homeassistant_api: true`, which let the
container skip the token entirely and call `http://supervisor/core/api/...`
using an auto-injected `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN`. That's been removed: it's a
standing network-access grant to Home Assistant's Core API that isn't scored
by Home Assistant's add-on security rating but is still a real privilege,
and the token-based method above already covers the same need with one extra
step (pasting a token into the Configuration tab) instead of a permanent
grant. Use `${env:HA_TOKEN}` against your instance's normal address
(`http://homeassistant.local:8123/api/...` or similar) as shown above.

## 5. Uploading/replacing dynglance.yml from the Configuration tab

The `/config-upload` page (see [Config Upload](authentication.md#config-upload))
is also a Configuration-tab toggle when running as the add-on: turn on
**Config Upload** and set a **Config Upload passphrase** (12+ characters),
and the passphrase-gated page becomes available with no YAML editing at all
- the add-on manages the `config-upload:` section of `dynglance.yml` for
you. Leaving the passphrase blank (or under 12 characters) keeps it disabled
even if the toggle is on, so a half-filled-in option can't accidentally
start the app with a broken config.

## 6. Referencing config files that live in your Home Assistant config folder

The add-on maps Home Assistant's own config directory into the container,
read-only, at `/homeassistant`. Combined with `dynglance.yml`'s `$include`
directive, this lets you keep widget definitions alongside the rest of your
Home Assistant config (e.g. under a `dynglance/` folder you already sync or
back up) instead of duplicating them into the add-on's own `/config`:

```yaml
# in /addon_configs/<slug>/dynglance.yml
pages:
  - name: Home
    columns:
      - size: full
        widgets:
          - $include: /homeassistant/dynglance/home-widgets.yml
```

`/homeassistant/dynglance/home-widgets.yml` is then just a plain YAML list of
widgets (or any other includable fragment), edited directly from the Home
Assistant `/config` folder via the File editor/Studio Code Server add-ons,
Samba, or an automation that regenerates it. Included files are watched the
same as `dynglance.yml` itself, so edits apply automatically without
restarting the add-on.

If you're running the standalone Docker container instead of the add-on,
the equivalent is mounting the folder yourself, e.g.
`-v /path/to/ha/config:/homeassistant:ro`.

### The add-on's three mapped directories

- `addon_config` → `/config`, read-write: where `dynglance.yml`, custom
  CSS/assets and themes live. Editable from the Studio Code Server or File
  editor add-ons.
- `share` → `/share`, read-only: only useful if a widget needs to read files
  that already live in Home Assistant's shared folder (e.g. bookmarked local
  docs). Nothing in DynGlance writes to `/share`, hence read-only.
- `homeassistant_config` → `/homeassistant`, read-only: see section 6 above.

## 7. Pushing data from Home Assistant instead of polling

The recipes above are pull-based: DynGlance polls Home Assistant on
`cache`'s schedule (as low as a few seconds, though very short intervals add
load to both sides). There is currently no push/webhook-receiver widget that
would let a Home Assistant automation notify DynGlance the instant something
changes - polling with a short `cache` is the supported approach today. A
generic webhook-ingest widget is a reasonable feature request; see the
project's issue tracker if you'd like to propose one.

## Security rating

`docker_api` is **off by default** (`config.yaml`). The `server-stats`
widget (host CPU/RAM/disk/temperature) doesn't touch Docker at all - it
reads `/proc`, `/sys`, and similar directly via `gopsutil`, both for its
built-in `type: local` mode and for a remote agent's HTTP endpoint - so it
never needed this privilege. Only the separate `docker-containers` and
`docker-controller` widgets (listing/controlling containers) actually
require the Docker socket.

With `docker_api` off, an AppArmor profile shipped (`apparmor.txt`), and
Ingress enabled, the add-on reaches the maximum score under Home Assistant
Supervisor's own rating logic (`supervisor/apps/utils.py`): baseline 5 +
Ingress's +2 + AppArmor's +1 = **8 of 8**.

If you want the Docker widgets instead, set `docker_api: true` back in
`config.yaml` and rebuild a local copy of the add-on (also uncomment the
Docker socket rules in `apparmor.txt` - they're left in place, commented
out, for exactly this). Per Supervisor's rating logic that's an
unconditional override:

```python
# Docker Access & full Access
if app.access_docker_api or app.with_full_access:
    rating = 1
```

It forces the rating to 1 regardless of anything else the add-on does right
- Ingress and the AppArmor profile still apply, they just can't move the
number while this override is in effect. There is no config.yaml option,
schema field, or Supervisor REST API that makes `docker_api` conditional -
it's read once from the add-on's manifest at install/update time. Two
things worth knowing if you go this route:
- **Protection mode** (Settings → Add-ons → DynGlance → Info tab, or
  `POST /apps/{slug}/security` / `POST /addons/{slug}/security` with
  `{"protected": false}`) is a real, existing, per-installation toggle -
  but it does **not** affect the rating number, which reflects what the
  add-on's manifest *requests*, not what's currently granted. What it does
  affect is whether the Docker socket is actually mounted at runtime
  (`supervisor/docker/app.py`: `if not app.protected and app.access_docker_api:
  mounts.append(MOUNT_DOCKER)`) - with protection mode left on (the
  default), the socket isn't mounted even though `docker_api: true` is
  declared, so the widgets still won't work until you turn it off.
- Toggling protection mode back on later doesn't retroactively re-secure
  anything already running - it takes effect on the next container
  recreate, not the next start/stop.

**Does `server-stats`' `type: local` mode need `host_pid`/`host_network` to
see real host-level numbers?** Checked `pkg/sysinfo/sysinfo.go` and how
Linux/Docker expose `/proc` and mount namespaces - the four things it
reports break down like this:

- **Uptime, CPU, memory** - all three are read from `/proc/uptime`,
  `/proc/stat`, and `/proc/meminfo`. None of these are namespace-virtualized
  by a standard container runtime (that requires something like `lxcfs`,
  which isn't in play here) - a container without `host_pid` still sees the
  *host's* real boot time, CPU accounting, and total/used physical memory
  through these files. This add-on already reports accurate host-wide
  numbers for all three with zero elevated privileges.
- **Disk** is different in kind, not degree: mountpoint usage is read via
  each filesystem's actual mount, and mounts are inherently scoped to the
  container's own mount namespace - there's no `/proc`-style loophole here.
  With this add-on's current `map:` list, `server-stats` sees `/data`,
  `/config`, `/homeassistant`, `/share`, and the container's own root
  overlay - not the Raspberry Pi's real root filesystem/SD card as a whole.

So three of the four already work exactly as intended with no extra
privilege, and disk is a real, structural limitation - but not one that
`host_pid`, `host_network`, `full_access`, or any other elevated grant
would actually fix (mount namespaces aren't affected by any of those). The
two real options, in order of preference:
1. **Point `server-stats` at a remote agent running directly on the host**
   instead of `type: local` - the widget already supports this over plain
   HTTP (see [Server Stats](configuration.md#server-stats)), and it needs
   *zero* elevated Supervisor privileges, since it's just an outbound HTTP
   call this add-on already makes for other widgets.
2. **Bind-mount the host's root filesystem in in** (e.g. via `/` mapped
   read-only) - technically possible but a much larger grant than anything
   discussed above, on par with `full_access`; not recommended.

## Further tightening (2026.08.23.4)

With the above confirmed, the AppArmor profile and `map:` list were
tightened further to match reality rather than being defensively broad:
- `share:rw` → `share:ro` in `config.yaml` (nothing in DynGlance writes to
  `/share`), and the matching AppArmor rule for it and `/homeassistant`
  narrowed to read-only.
- Removed `/etc/passwd r,` and the `dynglance_bin` profile's `/tmp/** rw,`
  from `apparmor.txt` - verified via source (no `os/user` import, no
  `/etc/passwd` or `os.TempDir`/`/tmp` reference anywhere in the Go code)
  that the running binary never touches either.

The outer bootstrap profile's broader `/bin/** ix,`/`/usr/bin/** ix,`
execute rules were deliberately left alone: they cover bashio's own
internal dependency chain (jq and various coreutils), which isn't something
that can be safely enumerated by reading this repo's source - narrowing it
without the `complain`-mode-plus-audit-log process the official Home
Assistant add-on template itself recommends risks breaking add-on startup
outright, which is worse than a somewhat generous bootstrap profile in
front of a tightly-scoped one for the actual long-running process.
