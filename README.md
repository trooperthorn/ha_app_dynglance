## Configuration
Configuration is done through YAML files, to learn more about how the layout works, how to add more pages and how to configure widgets, visit the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/trooperthorn/ha_app_dynglance/blob/main/docs/docs/configuration.md#configuring-dynglance).

## Home Assistant add-on
DynGlance can also be installed as a Home Assistant add-on, running the same container under Supervisor with Ingress support. See [`ha-addon/dynglance/DOCS.md`](ha-addon/dynglance/DOCS.md) for installation steps and add-on specific configuration.

## Maintainer notes
Release process, architecture rationale, dated design decisions, and the TODO backlog for this fork live in [`docs/operations.md`](docs/operations.md), [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md), [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md), and [`docs/backlog.md`](docs/backlog.md).

## Common issues
<details>
<summary><strong>Requests timing out</strong></summary>

The most common cause of this is when using Pi-Hole, AdGuard Home or other ad-blocking DNS services, which by default have a fairly low rate limit. Depending on the number of widgets you have in a single page, this limit can very easily be exceeded. To fix this, increase the rate limit in the settings of your DNS service.

If using Podman, in some rare cases the timeout can be caused by an unknown issue, in which case it may be resolved by adding the following to the bottom of your `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
networks:
  podman:
    external: true
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Broken layout for markets, bookmarks or other widgets</strong></summary>

This is almost always caused by the browser extension Dark Reader. To fix this, disable dark mode for the domain where DynGlance is hosted.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>cannot unmarshal !!map into []dynglance.page</strong></summary>

The most common cause of this is having a `pages` key in your `dynglance.yml` and then also having a `pages` key inside one of your included pages. To fix this, remove the `pages` key from the top of your included pages.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cannot embed DynGlance in an iframe</strong></summary>

By default DynGlance only allows itself to be embedded on the same origin (`frame-ancestors 'self'`). To allow embedding from another host such as Homepage, add the `allowed-embed-hosts` option under `server` in your `dynglance.yml`:

```yaml
server:
  allowed-embed-hosts:
    - https://homepage.mydomain.com
```

You can list multiple origins. Each entry must be a full origin including the scheme (e.g. `https://`).
